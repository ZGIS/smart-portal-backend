        "abstract": "Groundwater is used extensively in New Zealand for urban and rural water supply, agriculture and industry, and thus the quality of existing supplies must be monitored and protected. This investigation focuses on groundwater concentrations of iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn), which can pose health risks and cause a variety of engineering and aesthetic problems at high concentrations. This study used a compilation of close to 10,000 groundwater samples that had been collected by 15 regional authorities and analysed for Fe and/or Mn. The median values for dissolved Fe and Mn were 0.08 and 0.01 g m-3, respectively. Of the samples tested, 36% exceeded the aesthetic guideline values for Fe (0.2 g m-3) and 39% exceeded the values for Mn (0.05 g m-3). Of the samples tested for Mn, 15% exceeded the maximum allowable value for health (0.5 g m-3). Groundwaters from aquifers in basalt, shellbed and sandstone are the least likely to have high concentrations of Fe and/or Mn, whereas groundwaters from gravel and sand aquifers are the most likely to have elevated Fe and/or Mn concentrations. The groundwater Fe and Mn concentrations are not correlated to one another or to pH or water extraction depth, so (redox) equilib-rium-based models do not accurately predict Fe and Mn concentrations in groundwaters.",

        "title": "Chemical zonation in groundwater of the Central Plains, Canterbury",
        "abstract": "The extensive groundwater beneath the Central Canterbury Plains is an important source of domestic water. In some areas the potability of groundwater is at risk from high nitrate-N concentrations. Nitrate contamination originates from both point and non-point sources. Grazed pastureland and cropland (non-point sources) contribute about 92 percent of the total nitrate-N load (4,171,000 kg per yr) on Central Plains groundwater. Major point sources, including septic tanks, piggeries and meatworks, contribute the remainder. Sewage farms and dairy farms make a relatively insignificant contribution. Central Plains groundwater has been divided into three chemical zones. Zone (1) lies in regions of recharge from rivers; zone (2) includes unconfined and semi-confined groundwater down to 60 m below the water table, and some shallow confined groundwater; and zone (3) comprises all deep circulating groundwater. Nitrate-N concentrations in zones (1) and (3) are less than 1 g m-3. These concentrations exhibit little seasonal variation and no long-term variation. Zone (3) appears to be protected naturally from contamination originating at the land surface. Concentrations range between 4 and 8 g m-3 over large regions of zone (2) and exceed 10 g m in parts of the Islington Â— Burnham Â— Lincoln area. The magnitude of seasonal fluctuations in nitrate level depends on depth below water table and proximity to point sources. Longer-term fluctuations (during the period of study) appear to result from variation in the amounts of recharge and not from changes in land use. The apparent separation of shallow and deep groundwater has important implications for groundwater quality management. Zone (2) groundwater cannot be maintained at a potable level if non-point sources remain uncontrolled. Major land-use changes will probably not, however, affect the existing high quality of groundwater in zones (1) and (3). A programme for domestic water reticulation from zone (3) groundwater should be initiated across the Central Plains.",

        "abstract": "The economic value of groundwater to abstractive users in the Waimea Plains, Nelson, is estimated to be approximately $250 million. The resource is worth an estimated $38 million to $42 million to the 260 irrigators on the Waimea Plains, $173 million to the fifteen commercial/industrial users, and an estimated $33 million to the bulk water supplier. The marginal value of water to irrigators is estimated in the range $240 to $300 per allocated cubic metre. The mean willingness to pay to maintain groundwater in-situ to keep springs and rivers flowing, and prevent salt water intrusion, could not be estimated from 180 responses to a questionnaire sent to Waimea Plains households. However an estimate on the lower bound of willingness to pay for a 20% reduction in extractive use is $183 per household. Aggregated over 6,300 households, the lower bound estimate provides an annual value of $1.2 million for the in situ groundwater. The net benefits of reducing extraction by 20% range from $10.4 million to -$1.6 million, depending on the discount rate used. New ZealandÂ’s total water resource is likely to be worth substantially more than the $2340 million calculated in a previous estimate because the economic value of groundwater abstraction estimated in this paper represents barely 1% of New ZealandÂ’s total consumptive water allocation and 3% of New ZealandÂ’s groundwater allocation.",

        "abstract": "Groundwater is susceptible to contamination from a range of land-use activities, while remediation is very expensive and often impractical. To help mitigate this problem an effective regional vulnerability assessment, based on existing databases which provide a consistent national coverage, was developed. One of the critical factors affecting vulnerability in the Manawatu area of New Zealand is the potential effect of the soil, through its sorption capacity, on the fate of contaminants. Organic carbon content is often the most important factor controlling a soil&apos;s sorption capacity, but because carbon content declines sharply decline below the A horizon, the sorption model developed also considers the cation exchange capacity of the profile, particularly at lower depths. Soil data were obtained from the New Zealand Land Resource Inventory and the Manawatu - Wanganui regional soil database. Correlation of the two databases allowed the creation of cation exchange capacity, organic carbon content, and soil sorption maps for the study area. An uncertainty ranking system was derived to indicate the reliability of these maps. Soil sorption is relatively low for the soils over the northern Tararua foothill and other recharge zones, so little, or no, contaminant attenuation occurs there. As contaminants are more likely to reach the aquifer, controls on potentially contaminating land use activities are particularly important in these areas. Highest uncertainty in the estimates of vulnerability as a result of soil sorption, reflecting the present lack of chemical data for these soils, is around inland Horowhenua where land use is very intensive and where many bores provide drinking water.",

        "abstract": "This investigation involved a field trial to assess the possible effects of different sampling procedures on the chemistry of groundwater samples from 49 typical State of the Environment (SOE) monitoring sites in the Wellington (including Wairarapa), Marlborough and Canterbury regions. The results indicate that it is essential to adequately purge standing water from the well prior to sample collection to ensure that the water samples will be representative of groundwater within the aquifer. Adequate purging requires removal of three times the volume of water in the well under ambient non-pumping conditions and simultaneous stabilisation of pH, conductivity and temperature readings to within Â±0.1 pH units, Â±3%, and Â±0.2ÂºC, respectively. The results also indicate that samples should be collected sequentially and directly from a sample point rather than from an intermediate container (e.g., a bucket). There were no significant differences in anion results from filtered versus unfiltered samples. Filtration can be performed either with in-line filters or with syringes and syringe-tip filters. The results from this investigation will assist with the development of a single best-practice sampling procedure that will allow for meaningful comparison of SOE groundwater quality data at the regional and national scales, even if the samples were collected by different people or at different times.",

Because underground water represents a hidden resource, indirect methods, namely well drilling, must be used in any attempt to better understand underground water supplies. The information obtained from boreholes therefore is of paraÂ¬mount importance. With the greater number of wells being drilled at present, together with the well records already on file, computer-based systems for information retrieval offer definite promise for the future. A key factor in the design of such a system is the nature of the manÂ–computer dialogue. Question-and-answer, menu-selection and natural-English type dialogues are particularly well suited for the retrieval of water-well records from data files. Whichever system is put forward, it is important that potential users of the system be involved in all stages of development.",

Model simulations evaluated the optimal yield of the aquifers given the constraints of preventing sea-water intrusion or excessive water level declines, and maintaining minimum river flows. Other simulations showed the seasonal fluctuations in head when no pumpage is occurring, and the impacts of irrigation scheme proposals. Results of this modelling assisted the Nelson Catchment Board in formulating management policies for the water resources of the Waimea Plains restricting summer water usage.",

Both strains appear to meet certain safety criteria pertaining to non-pathogenicity, absence of plasmid-borne (non-transferable) antibiotic resistance factors and inability to become established in the human gastro-intestinal tract. The organisms were recovered from water samples by membrane filtration and incubated on MacConkey agar impregnated with the appropriate antibiotic. A nalidixic acid concentration of 75 mg/litre for the recovery of E. coil J6-2 and a rifampycin concentration of 50 mg/litre for the recovery of E. coli PB 922 caused total suppression of background faecal coliform bacteria in sewage without reducing counts of the tracer organisms. Both E. coli 76-2 and E. coli PB 922 exhibited survival rates in laboratory-stored groundwater samples that were similar to an E. coil neotype. Both strains were successfully used to trace the movement of sewage-polluted groundwater over a distance of 920 m.",

Groundwater aquifers and spring discharges to the north and west of Lake Rerewhakaaitu are found to contain up to 79% lake water. Hierarchical cluster analysis is used to group sites into three clusters based on the major anion/cation water chemistry. Defining meaningful hierarchical clusters was difficult due to the similarity of the chemical compositions between sites. The three clusters defined in this study do not clearly identify the sites containing lake water. However, the hierarchical cluster analyses can be used to infer sites that are likely to contain proportions of lake water in the groundwater, and therefore provides a method to identify sites that may contain lake water. The groundwater and spring discharges to the north and west of Lake Rerewhakaaitu flow into a different surface water catchment, thus providing a hydrological link between two different surface water catchments. This has implications for catchment management in the greater Rerewhakaaitu area.",

        "title": "Effect of logging on groundwater flow and hydrochemistry in the Waimarino catchment, Lake Taupo, New Zealand",
        "abstract": "Changes in water quality and water levels in a groundwater system beneath a Pinus Radiata plantation that had been clear felled were investigated using information on water levels, water chemistry, water dating, geology and land use during a five year monitoring period. No significant changes were observed in groundwater chemistry (major anions and cations) in the deep wells monitored over the period. Two shallow wells showed minor seasonal variations in groundwater chemistry, which were probably caused by greater evapotranspiration during the summer. CFC and tritium water dating show that the mean residence time of groundwater in the Waimarino catchment ranged from less than 2-5 years to greater than 80 years. The large residence times suggests that infiltration of surface water into the deep groundwater system is very slow, so short-term changes in groundwater chemistry are unlikely to be observed under natural conditions in the deep aquifers. However, NH4-N concentrations in the deep aquifers are higher than would be expected under the forestry area, suggesting some disturbance of the natural conditions, possibly by ancient forest fires or land disturbance before the pine forests were planted. Water level data show that the aquifer system is hydrologically linked to the Waimarino River and Lake Taupo. The water level data suggest that the Waimarino River gains groundwater from the east side of the river, but loses water to the groundwater system to the west. The entire system, except for the deep ignimbrite aquifer, appears to respond rapidly to rainfall, but because the mean residence time of the water in the aquifers is much longer than the time required for recharging water to respond to single rainfall events, the response is interpreted as being caused by pressure loading of the aquifer. No changes in groundwater chemistry and water levels due to the logging event are observed in this data over the monitoring period. This would be expected from a groundwater system with large mean groundwater residence times, suggesting any changes due to the effects of land use may take many years to be observed.",

Steady-state groundwater outflow from the river bed in the reaches between Courtenay and Old State Highway Bridge totals 12.9 m3/s, providing the major source of groundwater for the Christchurch City area. Groundwater use in the Christchurch City area averages 1.7 m3/s and baseflow in spring-fed rivers and streams is an estimated 10.9 m3/s. Waimakariri River bed reaches are within the groundwater catchments of springfed rivers and streams. The reaches between Courtenay Road and Weedons Ross Road (groundwater outflow 3.7 m3/s) provided most of the baseflow in the Halswell, Heathcote and Avon rivers (surface water baseflow 3.6 m3/s); reaches between Weedons Ross Road and Wrights Cut (groundwater outflow 8.3 m3/s) provided baseflow (7.3 m3/s) to the Old South Branch, Styx River and streams north of the Waimakariri River. Mean daily groundwater outflow from the five losing Waimakariri River reaches, assessed with a model that is primarily based on groundwater level observations in the Crossbank monitoring array located beside the river, was relatively uniform (standard deviation of approximately 1.0 m3/s) over a wide range in mean daily river flow (approximately 27 to 1310 m3/s) in the period 1 July 2002 to 30 June 2008. Mean daily groundwater outflow was greater at higher mean daily Waimakariri River flows, e.g., a groundwater outflow of 17.0 m3/s was estimated at river flows above 240 m3/s. However differences in groundwater outflow in two river flow ranges (27-60 m3/s and 60-120 m3/s) are not statistically significant. Groundwater outflow from the Waimakariri River was the most important control on the chemistry of groundwater in the Springston Formation aquifer and spring-fed rivers and streams. For example, low nitrate-nitrogen concentrations in the Waimakariri River (mean 75 &amp;#956;g/L) were reflected in low concentrations measured in Crossbank groundwater level monitoring array wells (mean 82 &amp;#956;g/L) and the Old South Branch stream (range 200-500 &amp;#956;g/L). Low nutrient (i.e., carbon, phosphorus and nitrogen) concentrations estimated in groundwater outflow from the Waimakariri River imply a low faunal density in the Springston Formation aquifer near the river.",

Model identification and parameter estimation were done by the Simple Refined Instrumental Variable (SRIV) algorithm using MICROCAPTAIN software. First-order and second-order transfer function models fitted the 23 years data with R2 values of 0.88 and 0.90 respectively. Noise was modelled as a second-order autoregressive process and incorporated into a forecast equation. A second-order model had the lowest one-step-ahead forecast error variance of 0.0041 of total variance. Split-sample calibration demonstrated the superior predictive ability of the first-order model. Simple regression equations at zero time lag provided good water-level estimates at other bores from short records concurrent with the monitoring bore. The simulation and forecast models were implemented using spreadsheet software.",

        "abstract": "The degree to which fog interception can augment water yields from snow tussock grasslands in the uplands of east Otago has been debated for over 40 years. Initially, the discussion centred on conflicting results from lysimetry-based studies. More recently, results from a stable isotope analysis suggest that fog and rain may contribute to the soil and groundwater stores in approximately equal proportions, raising the possibility that fog deposition may add as much to stream discharge as rainfall. To test this notion, we compare the mean annual water yield measured from five catchments in the east Otago uplands ranging in size from 1.2 to 60 km2 (Glendhu, Elbow Creek, Deep Creek at Muster Huts, Deep Creek, and Upper Deep Stream) with predicted water yield using the WATYIELD water balance model. Because the model makes no allowance for fog input in its water balance calculations, our hypothesis is that any excess in measured over modelled water yield may at the outset be assigned to fog. Deep Creek and Upper Deep Stream were the only catchments to show any excess. For Deep Creek the excess averaged 30 mm a year, which is less than the error with which the average annual water yield of 836 mm is measured for this catchment. At Upper Deep Stream the excess averaged 230 mm per year over a 7-year period, which is approximately 15% of the catchment area rainfall. However, not all of this can be automatically attributed to extra input from unmeasured fog. Rain gauge under-catching, and suppressed transpiration, may also explain some of this difference. Thus, while fog, under some circumstances, may be capable of contributing to annual water yield at the catchment scale, it is not doing so in approximately equal proportions with respect to rainfall in the examined catchments.",
